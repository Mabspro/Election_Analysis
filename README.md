## Challenge Overview
The challenge was fun. It allowed me to get a real world sense of data analysis based on real world data and got to see the power of analysis with Python.

## Challenge Summary
Overall the analysis proved to be a bit of a challenge but was able to exercise patience and dedication even in the face of time that seemed to get away from me a bit. I have learned alot about the application and utilization of Python to analyze real world data.
