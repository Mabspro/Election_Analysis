# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us the following task to complete the election audit of a recent loacl congressional election.
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 of votes.
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 of votes.
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 of the votes.
- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 of votes.

## Challenge Overview
The project showed overall voter engagement in the collective counties in the region. And even though it did not itemize the party affiliation of the voters, the margin of victory at 50% (vote spread between the 1st and 2nd place) for the winner shows that voters were excited about them and thereby the sentiment of the moment. 

## Challenge Summary
Going forward this scrypt can help the county in analyzing and getting a sense of voter sentiment, vote spread, county voter participation and an overall year to year snapshot of the vote count. This would allow for a more informed allocation of funds and perhaps understanding of the voters in the region.
